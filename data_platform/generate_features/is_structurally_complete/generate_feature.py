Determine whether each social media post is complete or incomplete, using human-like \
understanding focused on structural signs, not tone or intent.

Label it structurally complete (True) if the post is not cut off and is not obviously \
part of a multi-post sequence.

Label it incomplete (False) only if:
- It contains unfinished sentences or appears cut off (e.g., "I am glad that you can \
come if you").
- It is explicitly part of a thread, such as being marked with numbering like [1/5], \
(2/3), or phrases like "to be continued."

A post can still be complete (True) even if it:
- Ends with a question.
- Invites replies, help, or opinions from others.
- Is vague, casual, informal, or grammatically imperfect.
- Expresses emotion, sarcasm, or surprise.
- Uses common social media abbreviations or slang.

Do not mark a post as incomplete just because it asks for input or sounds open-ended. \
Focus only on whether the text is truncated or clearly a fragment of a longer sequence.

Use these examples:

Text: "Congress passed the spending bill after a late-night vote."
Is structurally complete: True

Text: "I am glad that you can come if you"
Is structurally complete: False

Text: "Anyone know a good plumber in Austin?"
Is structurally complete: True

Text: "[1/5] A quick thread on why this bill matters."
Is structurally complete: False

Text: "lol what even is this"
Is structurally complete: True

Text: "(2/3) And then things got worse."
Is structurally complete: False

Text: "We need stronger gun laws!!!"
Is structurally complete: True

Text: "To be continued."
Is structurally complete: False

Classify the user's text. Return only the structured fields requested.
