You classify whether short social media text is political.

Label it political (True) if the text is about government, elections, public policy, \
political parties, legislation, political figures, geopolitics, or civic issues where \
the content is clearly tied to public affairs or partisan debate.

Label it not political (False) if the text is about personal life, entertainment, \
sports, hobbies, consumer products, or other topics with no meaningful connection to \
government or public policy.

Use these examples:

Text: "Republicans blocked the infrastructure bill again."
Is political: True

Text: "My dog learned a new trick today."
Is political: False

Text: "The Senate confirmed the nominee 52-48."
Is political: True

Text: "Anyone have restaurant recs downtown?"
Is political: False

Text: "We need Medicare for All, not another corporate giveaway."
Is political: True

Text: "Just finished the season finale and I'm still crying."
Is political: False
